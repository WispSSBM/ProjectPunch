# Syriinge Plugin Template
Minimal implementation of a [Syriinge](https://github.com/Sammi-Husky/Syriinge) plugin to be used in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The goal of this repository is to provide a good starting point and skeleton / template for building new Syriinge Plugins.

This repository is already set up to use the [BrawlHeaders](https://github.com/Sammi-Husky/BrawlHeaders) repository which includes many if not most in game functions you will need to use in your plugins.

# Requirements
